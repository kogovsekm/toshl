I'd like to thank DLabs for giving me a chance to participate in the test day. The app is by no means finished, or good looking, but hopefully with your permission I'd like to improve it as much as I can with the tools given for the test (API) in the next days and make it work. My knowledge is lacking, but I am a quick learner and highly motivated. I hope you'll keep me in your database for any future opportunities.
